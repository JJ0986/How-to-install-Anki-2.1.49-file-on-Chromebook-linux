# How-to-install-Anki-2.1.49-file-on-Chromebook-linux
Before you run all the commands in my main file, download anki linux file first in a browser.
once anki .tar file is installed, you need to move the file into the 'Linux file section so the terminal can find the anki file
once the file is in 'linux files' folder, start running all the commands and enjoy :)

Here are the list of useful anki-2.1.49 version add ons that 2.1.8 don't have:
just go on tools and then add on to type in the code for the add on

1. Review heatmap - 723520343

3. Button colors - 2494384865

There are also plenty of videos on which add on u should download and it's totally up to you which add on you install and these are the ones i think r the best for anki
